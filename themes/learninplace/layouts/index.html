                COVID-19 is shutting down schools all over the world. We've been sheltering in place since the middle of
                March. Our school district, San Jose Unified, has announced that school will not resume this year but
                learning will still take place online.

                Most children didn't have the opportunity to take home school supplies on the last day of school. Some
                families aren't able to easily replace those supplies. This site will explain how we purchased supplies,
                packaged them and distributed them.
