We're a family in the Willow Glen area of San Jose.  We're lucky enough to be OK through this lockdown.  We know a lot of people in our school district and neighborhood aren't so lucky.  This is our attempt to help out.  

## Spreading the word
This site is not trying to raise money.  We want to show you how to make the kits and let you figure out the best way to do this in your community.  We didn't raise any money for this.  Our aim is to get the best resources for a reasonable amount of money so more people can take part.  We also want it to be a fun family activity.  We're all at home anyway and puzzles might be getting a little monotonous.

## Materials
We're always looking to buy supplies that have a decent level of quality at the best price.  That way we can make more kits for more people.  My children are elementary age so that informs what I've put in my kits.  You can add or remove items as it makes sense.
