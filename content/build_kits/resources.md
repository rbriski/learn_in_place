We created a [small insert](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qH_Pv4qBrl3EMnV2FTLED9eLKQ8mrr1JJdQh4TGRbNU/edit?usp=sharing) for each of the kits that gives information about what is in the kit and where to get more information about distance learning in the community.

Our local school district has been pretty good about putting up learning resources.  We also have weekly lesson plans and scheduled video sessions with teachers.  

### Bilingual information
We also translated this to Spanish to make it more accessible.  

### Website information
Our school district keeps changing the actual web address where the COVID-19 materials are located.  In order to keep the link working, even if the website was changed again, I have a redirect from this site to whatever happens to be the current COVID-19 site for our school district.
