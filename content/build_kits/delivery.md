Our local school district, San Jose USD, is distributing meals every weekday between 10:30AM and 11:30AM.  The pick up sites are all around the city, and one happens to be right down the street from us.  

I went down and asked if they would mind if I handed out the kits and they were fine with it.  So I popped on my mask and gloves and handed them out.  **They were so popular that I went through all of them in 30 minutes!**

## Some hints 

### Put a max number per car
One of the very first things I did was institute a 2 kit max per car if there weren't any kids.  I felt bad but I wanted to get them to a wide number of families so I couldn't really hand out 5 or 6 at a time.  If someone clearly had 3 kids in the car, I'd hand out 3 so it wasn't a hard rule.

### Leave the kids at home
I left my daughters at home for this part.  I had a mask and gloves but I was reaching out and handing these bags to people.  It didn't seem necessary or smart to have my kids come along.

### "Disinfecting" the kits
COVID-19 can't live on paper products for more than a day.  To ensure we didn't inadvertently infect someone, I packed up all of the bags in cardboard boxes and left them in the car over the weekend.  On Monday, I put on my gloves and mask and took them down to the pick up location.  The weekend would have killed anything from us and the mask and gloves made sure I didn't put anything on the bags or catch anything from people picking them up.

Obviously, the understanding of COVID-19 is constantly changing.  I used the CDC as my main source of information: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html.  If your more comfortable with additional precautions, you should follow those instead.
