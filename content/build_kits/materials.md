We got all of our materials on Amazon.  It just seemed like the easiest and safest thing to do.  I had initially looked at prebuilt kits but they ended being a lot more expensive than buying the items separately and then packing them together.  

The items we packed into our kits were geared toward elementary school classes.  The markers and crayons were the most expensive items in the kit so you could probably make more kits for middle schoolers and high schoolers.
