We got all of our materials on Amazon.  It just seemed like the easiest and safest thing to do.  I had initially looked at prebuilt kits but they ended being a lot more expensive than buying the items separately and then packing them together.  

The items we packed into our kits were geared toward elementary school classes.  The markers and crayons were the most expensive items in the kit so you could probably make more kits for middle schoolers and high schoolers.

## Cost information 

**Each bag costs $5.26**

To be fair, that's if you get 100% usage.  You can see by the quantities above that you don't.  We had to purchase 2 sets of crayons and notebooks and our limiting quantity ended up being markers at 36.  

**With "waste", each bag costs $7.58**

With tax and everything, my total cost was $272.92 so my actual cost per bag (36) was $7.58.  To get closer to the $5 figure, I would have to have better utilization.  

Dropping the markers is the most obvious way to get there but kids love markers.  Maybe for middle schoolers or high schoolers, you could drop the markers and crayons to make the price better.
